Hello! My name is Andrew Rodriguez. I am a PhD student at Texas State University (TXST) studying computer science. I am a member of the [Efficient Computing Laboratory (ECL)](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~mb92/), advised by Dr. Martin Burtscher. My research interests include nature-inspired algorithms, data compression, computational complexity and game theory.

Previously, I attended the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) and received my master's in computer science. I researched with the [Algorithmic Self-Assembly Research Group (ASARG)](https://asarg.hackresearch.com/main/) at UTRGV under Dr. Tim Wylie and Dr. Robert Schweller. Before that, I attended the University of Texas at Austin and received my bachelor's in computer science.

Outside of research, I love to read and write. My favorite book right now is 'Negative Space' by B. R. Yeager. I also enjoy watching movies, and making my own mixes of my favorite songs.
