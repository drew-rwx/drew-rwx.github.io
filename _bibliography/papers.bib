abstract = {The IEEE 754 floating-point standard is the most used representation for real numbers in modern computer systems, despite issues in accuracy for certain applications. The posit format, which has several advantages, has been proposed as a direct drop-in replacement for IEEE floats. Many works compare the use of posits to floats in a wide range of scientific computing domains. However, there has not been any work looking into the compressibility of posit data. In this paper, we compare the compression ratios of different algorithms when the input is encoded in IEEE format and in posit format. We evaluate 5 lossless general-purpose compressors as well as several new compression algorithms synthesized by our LC framework on 14 single-precision inputs from the SDRBench suite, encoded in float and posit format. Our results show that that 4 of the 6 compressors yield an average of 2.59\% reduction in compression ratio on posit data, whereas bzip2 provides a 1.74\% increase in compression ratio, with XZ providing the highest ratios for both encodings.},

abstract = {The popularity of molecular computation has given rise to several models of abstraction, one of the more recent ones being Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). These are equivalent to other popular computational models, such as Vector Addition Systems and Petri-Nets, and restricted versions are equivalent to Population Protocols. This paper continues the work on core reachability questions related to Chemical Reaction Networks; given two configurations, can one reach the other according to the system's rules? With no restrictions, reachability was recently shown to be Ackermann-complete, which resolved a decades-old problem. In this work, we fully characterize monotone reachability problems based on various restrictions such as the allowed rule size, the number of rules that may create a species (k-source), the number of rules that may consume a species (k-consuming), the volume, and whether the rules have an acyclic production order (feed-forward). We show PSPACE-completeness of reachability with only bimolecular reactions in two-source and two-consuming rules. This proves hardness of reachability in a restricted form of Population Protocols. This is accomplished using new techniques within the motion planning framework. We give several important results for feed-forward CRNs, where rules are single-source or single-consuming. We show that reachability is solvable in polynomial time as long as the system does not contain special void or autogenesis rules. We then fully characterize all systems of this type and show that with void/autogenesis rules, or more than one source and one consuming, the problems become NP-complete. Finally, we show several interesting special cases of CRNs based on these restrictions or slight relaxations and note future significant open questions related to this taxonomy.}

abstract = {Tile Automata is a recently defined model of self-assembly that borrows many concepts from cellular automata to create active self-assembling systems where changes may be occurring within an assembly without requiring attachment. This model has been shown to be powerful even with limited assembly size, but many fundamental questions have yet to be explored. Here, we study the state complexity of assembling n×n squares in seeded Tile Automata systems where growth starts from a seed and tiles attach one at a time, similar to the abstract Tile Assembly Model. We provide optimal bounds for three classes of seeded Tile Automata systems (all without detachment), which vary in the amount of complexity allowed in the transition rules. We show that, in general, seeded Tile Automata systems require Θ(log14⁡n) states. For single-transition systems, where only one state may change in a transition rule, we show a bound of Θ(log13⁡n), and for deterministic systems, where each pair of states may only have one associated transition rule, a bound of Θ((log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n)12). Along the way, we provide optimal bounds for the subroutines of building binary strings and building O(log⁡n)×n rectangles.}
